## Introduction

We present the numerical package **FOR**ward **E**xperiment **SE**nsitivity **E**stimator, or **FORESEE**, that can be used to simulate the expected sensitivity reach of experiments placed in the far-forward direction from the proton-proton interaction point. We also provide a comprehensive list of validated forward spectra of various SM species. 

### Paper

Our main publication [FORESEE: FORward Experiment SEnsitivity Estimator for the LHC and future hadron colliders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07077) provides an overview over this package. We recommend reading it first before jumping into the code.

### Tutorials

In the main folder in this repository, we provide tutorials for different LLP models: the dark photon, the dark Higgs, the ALP with W couplings, the ALP with photon coupling, the up-philic scalar. In addition we include examples for the scattering of Millicharged particles, as discussed in [arXiv:2205.09137](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09137), and the coherent convsersion of photons into ALPs, as discussed in [arXiv:2204.03599](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03599).
